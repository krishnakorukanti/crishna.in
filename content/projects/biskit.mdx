# Biskit: Bridging Restaurants and Customers

Biskit was a groundbreaking mobile application designed to streamline the dining experience by connecting restaurants directly to their customers. Through its intuitive interface and robust features, Biskit aimed to revolutionize the way people interacted with their favorite eateries.


## Features:

- **Effortless Ordering:** With Biskit, customers could effortlessly browse through a diverse array of restaurants, explore menus, and place orders with just a few taps on their smartphones.

- **Secure Payment Integration:** Biskit offered seamless and secure payment integration, allowing customers to complete transactions without any hassle or worry.

- **Real-Time Order Tracking:** Customers could track the status of their orders in real-time, ensuring transparency and peace of mind throughout the dining process.

- **Personalized Brand Pages:** Biskit empowered restaurants to create personalized brand pages, enabling them to showcase their unique offerings and connect with their customer base in a meaningful way.

- **In-App Marketing Tools:** The app provided powerful marketing tools that allowed restaurants to promote their products effectively and engage with their audience through targeted campaigns and promotions.

Despite its promising features and initial success, Biskit underwent a strategic pivot, leading to the shelving of the project. While the app is no longer active, its innovative approach to restaurant-customer connectivity continues to inspire future endeavors in the realm of dining technology.
