This website was built using a combination of technologies and tools. Here's a brief overview of the development process:

- **Framework:** Next.js

- **Styling:** The styling of the website was achieved using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that helped streamline the development process by providing a set of pre-designed utility classes for rapid prototyping and styling. Tailwind CSS allowed for quick iteration and consistent design across the entire website.

- **Deployment:** The website is hosted using a cloud platform Vercel. Continuous deployment pipelines were set up to automatically.

- **Customization:** While the Chronark template provided a solid foundation, customizations were made to tailor the website to my specific needs and preferences. This included modifying content, adjusting styles, and integrating additional features as necessary.

- **AI Integration:** The website features an AI-powered assistant that can help users with various tasks. This is implemented using OpenAI's API and includes features like:
  - Natural language processing capabilities
  - Context-aware responses
  - Integration with Redis for state management
  - Secure API key management

- **Repository:** The source code for this website is available on GitHub at [github.com/crishnakorukanti/crishna.in](https://github.com/crishnakorukanti/crishna.in). The repository includes:
  - Complete source code
  - Documentation
  - Development setup instructions
  - Security guidelines
  - Personality enhancements for the AI assistant
