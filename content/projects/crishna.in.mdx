This website was built using a combination of technologies and tools. Here's a brief overview of the development process:

- **Framework:** Next.js

- **Styling:** The styling of the website was achieved using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that helped streamline the development process by providing a set of pre-designed utility classes for rapid prototyping and styling. Tailwind CSS allowed for quick iteration and consistent design across the entire website.

- **Deployment:** The website is hosted using a cloud platform Vercel. Continuous deployment pipelines were set up to automatically.

- **Customization:** While the Chronark template provided a solid foundation, customizations were made to tailor the website to my specific needs and preferences. This included modifying content, adjusting styles, and integrating additional features as necessary.

This portfolio website was created using the [chronark.com](https://chronark.com/) template available at [github.com/chronark/chronark.com](https://github.com/chronark/chronark.com).
Thank you, Chronark, for your creativity and generosity in sharing this template with the community.
