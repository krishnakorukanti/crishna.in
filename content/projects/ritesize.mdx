# Ritesize The easiest way to find reliable supply at the lowest price for recycled plastic.

## Introduction

Ritesize is a project we have developed to streamline the process of managing product sales orders. In this technical overview, I will provide a detailed insight into the technologies used, architecture, features, challenges faced, and future improvements of the Ritesize project.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **Next.js**: Next.js was chosen for its server-side rendering capabilities and ease of use in building React applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS was used for its utility-first approach, enabling rapid prototyping and styling.
- **ShadCn UI**: This is NOT a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

### Backend

- **Node.js**: Node.js served as the backend runtime environment, facilitating event-driven, non-blocking I/O operations.
- **Prisma**: Prisma was utilized as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for database interactions, offering type-safe database access.
- **PostgreSQL**: PostgreSQL was selected as the relational database management system for its robustness and scalability.

## Architecture Overview

The Ritesize project follows a client-server architecture, where the frontend interacts with the backend through RESTful APIs. The PostgreSQL database stores product and user-related data, managed by the Prisma ORM.

## Features Implementation

1. **Home Page with Products List**: The home page displays a list of products fetched from the backend and styled using Tailwind CSS.

2. **Product Info**: Product details are retrieved dynamically from the backend and rendered on the product info page.

3. **Login**: User authentication is implemented using Node.js, ensuring secure access to the application.

4. **Submit a Product Sales Order**: Users can submit sales orders through a form, and then track using the order id.

5. **Dashboard**: A user dashboard provides personalized insights and access to order history.

6. **CMS (Content Management System)**: Backend CMS allows administrators to manage content dynamically.

7. **Order Status**: Users can track the status of their orders in real-time.
