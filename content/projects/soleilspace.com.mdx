At Soleil Space, we're passionate about elevating the voices and stories of the Global South diasporas â€“ the filmmakers and audiences of Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Middle East. We believe these diverse communities deserve a platform to share their unique perspectives and experiences with the world. That's why we built Soleil Space, a streaming platform available on web, iOS, and Android.

**Building a Global Stage with Powerful Technology**

Developing Soleil Space for multiple platforms wasn't easy, but it was absolutely necessary to reach our global audience. Here's a glimpse into the process:

* **Web App Foundation:** We started with a robust web application built with React, a popular JavaScript library that allows for efficient and scalable development. This ensures a smooth streaming experience for viewers on any desktop or laptop computer.

* **Reaching Mobile Users with React Native:** Recognizing the importance of mobile consumption, we leveraged React Native to create the Soleil Space mobile app experience for iOS and Android devices. React Native allows us to write most of the app's code in JavaScript, ensuring a consistent codebase and faster development compared to native app development for each platform. This lets users enjoy their favorite films and TV shows on the go, wherever they are.

* **Powering the Platform with Node.js:**  At the heart of Soleil Space lies a Node.js backend. Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime environment that efficiently handles server-side operations, data management, and communication with the mobile and web applications.

* **Ensuring a Unified Experience:**  A crucial aspect of development was creating a consistent user experience across all platforms. This means intuitive navigation, high-quality streaming, and easy access to features like recommendations and watchlists, regardless of the device you're using.

**A Platform Built for Community**

Soleil Space is more than just a streaming service; it's a community. Our platform allows users to:

* **Curate Film Collections:** Recommend movies and TV shows to friends and family, fostering discussions and expanding their cinematic horizons.
* **Connect with Fellow Film Enthusiasts:** Discover a network of like-minded individuals who share your passion for global storytelling.
